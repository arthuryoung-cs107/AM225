Precision--work data for low-order methods
==========================================
The four data files here contain the precision--work data for the four
low-order integration methods that were considered in the lectures: forward
Euler, Ralston, third-order Heun, and fourth-order Runge--Kutta.

The data uses the Brusselator ODE system. Each file contains two columns: (1)
the number of function evaluations, and (2) the absolute error from the
reference solution.
